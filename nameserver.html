<p><b><font size=+1>Introduction</font></b>
<br><font size=+1>The nameserver is used at Jefferson Lab to provide IP
addresses of EPICS process variables (PVs) to client programs. Without
a nameserver, client&nbsp; broadcast searches for PVs add to the load of
every IOC in the system. With&nbsp; the nameserver&nbsp; in use, broadcasts
are directed only to the nameserver, decreasing the load on the IOCs.&nbsp;
Performance tests&nbsp; have shown that PV connection time is twice as
fast when using the nameserver.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Two modes of operation are available. In normal mode,
information about the location of control system process variables (PVs)&nbsp;
is loaded into internal hashtables at startup. In learn mode,&nbsp; a client
request for information about an unknown PV triggers a broadcast by the
nameserver.If the PV is found,&nbsp; location information is added to the&nbsp;
hashtable. At Jefferson Lab, we use a combination of both modes, preloading
data for&nbsp; for <b>96</b> IOCs and ~<b>280k</b> PVs&nbsp; and learning
on demand about other less frequently requested PVs. Preloading results
in more deterministic operation&nbsp; and a startup time of less than 5
seconds. If the nameserver is running as a daemon process and a crash or
restart is done, clients attempting to connect will&nbsp; see a 5 second
delay&nbsp; but there will be no effect on clients which have already connected.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The nameserver runs on a Unix&nbsp; workstation and is
based on EPICS Portable Channel Access Server(PCAS) and the PCAS example
program "directoryServer".</font>
<p><b><font size=+1>User's Guide</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Software Installation</font></b>
<br><font size=+1>The distributed gzipped tar file contains source code,
makefiles, and sample configuration files. We use the EPICS utility "makeBaseApp"
to provide an environment for compiling the source code using Makefile.Host.&nbsp;
Scripts and documentation for "makeBaseApp" are&nbsp; available as part
of the EPICS distribution with documentation in the file "$EPICS/base/src/makeBaseApp/iocAppBuildSRcontrol.html".
At Jefferson Lab, EPICS configuration files are set up to use HP-UX 10.20
and the HP aCC compiler but the code <b>has compiled on Linux or Solaris</b>
without difficulty. <b>Before compiling, edit the file "directoryServer.h"
and modify the section labelled "SITE SPECIFIC MODIFICATIONS", following
the instructions in that file. </b>The executable,&nbsp; "caDirServ", should
be copied to the directory from which it will run. Note that only one PCAS
application may be run from any host.</font>
<p><b><font size=+1>System Configuration</font></b>
<br><font size=+1>At least two files must be created before the nameserver
can be run. The first file, with the defaultname "pvDirectory.txt", must
contain a list of full pathnames to one or more&nbsp; secondary files each
called&nbsp; "signal.list".&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>The&nbsp; name, "signal.list",
may be changed before the code is compiled. </b>At Jefferson Lab, our "pvDirectory.txt"
file contains <b>96</b> lines of text:</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /cs/op/iocs/iocmc1/signal.list</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /cs/op/iocs/iocmc2/signal.list</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; etc.</font>
<br><font size=+1>The next to last component of each pathname must be the
name of the IOC. The "pvDirectory.txt" file is best&nbsp; located in the
same directory as the executable code.</font>
<br><font size=+1>Our "signal.list" files are automatically created by
each IOCs on bootup by using the command "dbpr >> signal.list". These files
may be created by any convenient method but must contain one PV name per
line.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Currently, there is one more requirement that must be
met. Each "signal.list" file must contain one PV named "<i>iocname</i>:heartbeat"
and this PV must exist on the actual IOC. <b>The&nbsp; suffix, ":heartbeat",
may be changed before the code is compiled. </b>At Jefferson Lab, these
PVs update a counter every second and are used on medm screens to indicate
that the IOC is running. They may, in fact, be associated with any type
of record.</font>
<p><font size=+1>There is one exception to the set of requirements above.
If the file "pvDirectory" is empty, the nameserver will run in total learn
mode.&nbsp; This is not recommended for most efficient operation but may
be useful for testing.</font>
<p><b><font size=+1>Running the Nameserver</font></b>
<br><font size=+1>Set the environmental variables "EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST"
and "EPICS_CA_AUTO_ADDR_LIST"&nbsp; so that IOC's can be "seen" by the
nameserver. This can be done in the "start_nameserver" script.</font>
<br><font size=+1>cd to the directory containing the nameserver executable
and start "caDirServ".</font>
<br><font size=+1>Verify that the nameserver has created two new files
in this home directory: "nameserver.killer" and "nameserver.restart".</font>
<p><font size=+1>To test the code, from another xterm, set "EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST'
to the IP address of the machine which is running the nameserver. Set "EPICS_CA_AUTO_ADDR_LIST"
to "NO" to avoid&nbsp; problems with the client seeing the PVs twice, once
directly and again via the nameserver.</font>
<br><font size=+1>Verify that the nameserver is running by using "caget"
to read the value of "<i>iocname</i>:heartbeat". If the "caget"is successful,
attempt to get the values of other PVs on the same IOC and then on other
IOCs.</font>
<p><font size=+1>From the original xterm, kill the nameserver by executing
the nameserver.killer script.</font>
<br><font size=+1>Start the nameserver again using the -s argument to run
as a daemon process. Note that a log file is created.</font>
<br><font size=+1>Verify operation as above.</font>
<br><font size=+1>Execute the nameserver.restart script and confirm that
the original log file has been moved to a backup file and a new one has
been created,&nbsp; and that new killer&nbsp; and restart files have been
created.</font>
<p><font size=+1>To exercise the reporting option, look at the contents
of the nameserver.killer file and find the line after the comment "use
the following to get a PV summary report in log:". This will be a "kill
-USR1 <i>PID</i>" command. View the log file before and after executing
the command. Similarly, the USR2 signal will start a new log file.</font>
<p><b><font size=+1>Command Line Options</font></b>
<br><font size=+1>The nameserver front end is modelled after the EPICS
PCAS gateway code, and like the gateway, it may be run manually or as a
daemon process.&nbsp; As a daemon process, the executable can be signaled
to quit, to restart or to display run-time statistics. A log file may be
created in manual mode and will be created if the server is run as a daemon.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Command line arguments include:</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -f <i>filename</i> ......modify the
name of the default input file "pvDirectory.txt"</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -d nnn.............turn on and set
the level of PCAS debugging</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -l <i>logfilename</i> ..requests that
logging&nbsp; be done and allows specification of logfile name</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -c <i>directory .......</i>change
operational directory</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -s ....................use server
mode</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -h <i>nnn</i> ..............set hashtable
size (default = 300,000)</font>
<p><font size=+1>Included with the distributed code is the file "start_nameserver".
This script sets environmental variables and executes the nameserver process
with standard arguments.</font>
<p><b><font size=+1>Programmer's Guide</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Software Description</font></b>
<p><font size=+1>caDirServ is based on the Portable Channel Access Server
library and the example code "directoryServer", both of which are part
of the EPICS base distribution files. For information about PCAS, please
see the EPICS web site at Los Alamos,&nbsp; "http://mesa53.lanl.gov/lansce8/Epics/ca/ca.htm".</font>
<p><font size=+1>The EPICS PCAS library provides many virtual functions
which are normally replaced by the application developer, This application
uses only the&nbsp; "pvExistTest" function. The usual "read" and "write"
functions are not used and are&nbsp; effectively noops. The library provides
all low level code for channel access. On receipt of a client broadcast,
the library code calls the application "pvExistTest" function with the
PV name as an argument. In the nameserver code, the PV hashtable is checked.
If the PV is found, the IOC hashtable is checked to verify that the IOC
is up. If true, the function returns "pvExistReturn" along with socket
address information for the appropriate IOC. If the PV is not found in
the PV hashtable, the nameserver will attempt to learn by broadcasting
to find the PV and will return "pverDoesNotExistHere" for each request
for this PV&nbsp; until the information is known. If the PV is known but
the IOC is down,&nbsp; "pverDoesNotExistHere" will be returned. The rest
of the code is bookkeeping.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The nameserver maintains information on the status of
each IOC by setting up a channel access monitor for each "heartbeat" PV
and receiving channel access connection events.&nbsp; In this way, a PV
can be added, deleted&nbsp; or moved from one IOC to another and the disconnection/connection
sequence from the IOC will trigger updates to both the status of the IOCs
and the contents of the PV hashtable. <b>When a PV is moved from one IOC
to another, it is important to reboot the IOC which loses the PV before
rebooting the IOC which gains the PV.</b></font>
<p><font size=+1>The C++ code is quite simple with just over 1800 lines
of source code. In addition to the PCAS library, the nameserver uses two
EPICS hashtables to store information about PVs and IOCs and an EPICS singly
linked list to keep track of PVs for which broadcasts have been done&nbsp;
but haven't yet been found or timed out.&nbsp; <b>A third hash table stores
the names of PVs which never connect.</b></font>
<p><font size=+1>Unlike earlier versions of nameservers, no modifications
are necessary to either EPICS/base or to client code. Clients simply modify
EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST to direct broadcasts to the nameserver. The program
has been most effective when serving medm or burt, both of which do extensive
broadcasting.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The only problems seen so far are with client code which
has been compiled with very old versions of EPICS which use channel access
protocol version 4.4. This code has had to be recompiled to work with the
nameserver.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><b><font size=+1>This release of the code includes minor modifications
to logging. It also includes two #ifdef'd sections. The first, "JS_FILEWAIT",</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>is no longer used at JLab. At one time, the nameserver
would attempt to read incomplete signal.list files. Now our iocs write
their files before ioc initialization and this delaying code is no longer
needed here.&nbsp; The second #ifdef'd section, "PIOC", provides for serving
PIOC variables which may be deleted without a loss of a heartbeat. The
signal USR2 has been recoded as one way of handling these deletions.</font></b>
