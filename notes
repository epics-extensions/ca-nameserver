Fri Nov 22 09:20:21 CST 2002  -   caDirServ.20021001
	Now test hostname for both "." and ':'.
	Moved ca_flush_io.
	Made some portablility changes.
	Added '-n' option: Input Signal list filename is iocname 
	(else iocname is basename(dirname(name)) )

Fri Jul 23 09:30:31 CDT 2004
	Changes for R3.14 build
		Changes for tsSLList  (init and destroyAllEntries)
		Changes for cas server ( create pvExistTest(3parms) )
		Changes for tsSLIter
		Changes for osiTime, osiTimer (changed to epicsTime, epicsTimer)
		Changes for ca ( ca_task_initialize to ca_context_create)

Mon Jul 30 17:00:00 CDT 2004
	Changes for multiple iocs on a single workstation. 
	Added new class pvEHost for host specific linked list of pvEs. This linked 
	list is used to delete all pvs for a host when it becomes disconnected and
	reconnected.  Removed code for copy and read of private pvlist files.
	Modified installHostName to return pHost*.
	Modified pvE class to contain pHost* instead of pHostName char string.
	Modified filewait class to contain pHost* instead of pHostName char string.
	Changed code to set "struct sockaddr_in ipa" values after channel connects
	not when pHost is created.

	The pHost class now is an ioc class and hostname means iocname (not channel
	ca server name). Multiple ioc's can exist on a single ip host. The iocnames
	now may not have anything to do with the ip host name. The heartbeat pv has
	the name <iocname>:heartbeat. The iocname may be the ip host name in some 
	cases.

	If the search for an unknown pv connects and the ip host is not in the host 
	hash table, use the "host:port" string to create a pHost class and add it to
	the host hash table. 

Fri Aug 20 16:31:23 CDT 2004
	Make nameserver portable.
		No server mode (watcher process) on WIN32.
		No kill and restart scripts on WIN32.

		Remove usage of getopt.
		Remove usage of gettimeofday (use epicsTime).

	Allow PVname move from DOWN ioc to an UP ioc.

Thu Jun 30 13:49:36 CDT 2005
	Add non zero test for print of home_dir, log_file, fileName, pvlist_file.

Mon Sep 19 13:27:29 CDT 2005

	Functions to try to reserve a low number file descriptor for fopens 
	sometimes lost the low (<256 on solaris) fd to CA/CAS socket connections.
